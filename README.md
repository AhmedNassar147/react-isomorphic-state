# react-isomorphic-state
global state for react with no context

# why i don't like context or any lib using it.

# we have two cases 
```
  1- we have one context wraps your entire app
  <!-- so when a context gets updated it will rerender all components that use that context -->

  2- if your app app gets larger you will probably use multi contexts wrapping each other    
```
